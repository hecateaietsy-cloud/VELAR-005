## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New State Variables Added:
```javascript
const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState([]);
const [projects, setProjects] = useState([]);
const [parts, setParts] = useState([]);
const [selectedProject, setSelectedProject] = useState('');
const [selectedPart, setSelectedPart] = useState('');
const [loadingProjects, setLoadingProjects] = useState(false);
const [loadingParts, setLoadingParts] = useState(false);
```

### New API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/projects` - Fetch all projects
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/parts` - Fetch parts for selected project
- Existing: `GET /api/veriler` - Fetch duration data

### Key Functions Added:
- `fetchProjects()` - Loads available projects
- `fetchProjectParts(projectId)` - Loads parts for selected project
- `filterData()` - Filters duration data based on selections

### Effect Hooks:
- Project fetching on component mount
- Parts fetching when project changes
- Data filtering when any selection changes

## ðŸŽ¯ User Workflow

1. **Initial State**: Page loads with filter dropdowns but no data displayed
2. **Project Selection**: User selects a project from the first dropdown
3. **Work Order Loading**: Second dropdown populates with work orders for selected project
4. **Work Order Selection**: User selects a work order from the second dropdown
5. **Data Display**: Filtered process duration data appears showing only records for the selected project and work order
6. **Real-time Updates**: Any filter changes immediately update the displayed data

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements
